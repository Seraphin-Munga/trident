          Britannica harmless from and against all claims, liabilities, actions, damages, losses and costs (including
          reasonable attorneys' fees) that arise from any breach or alleged breach of any of the foregoing obligations,
          including without limitation from any claims that the use of any of the Subscribed-To Services by a Student

          b) Renewal Term Subscription Fees. Subject to the following sentence, Trident reserves the right to increase
          Subscription Fees by a maximum of 10%. Subscription Fees for any Renewal Term will not exceed Trident’s
          then-current subscription rates for similarly situated, new customers, and shall be subject to the payment

          highest
          amount permitted by the law, without the prejudice of Trident’s right to terminate this Agreement and the

          Services.

          <ol start="9">
            <li>Confidentiality</li>
          </ol>

          a) Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed by a party
          (“Disclosing
          Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as
          confidential
          or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the
          circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, business and marketing
          plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed by
          the
          Disclosing Party. Further, Confidential Information of Britannica includes all Britannica intellectual
          property,

          the
          public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (2) was known to the Receiving Party
          prior
          to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any

          threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful or embarrassing to any other person or entity, or is fraudulent or
          deceptive, (b) Subscriber’s use or unauthorised copying of the Services or the Britannica Content, or (c)
          Subscriber’s violation of any laws, rules, or regulations.

          13. Termination

          If Subscriber should breach any material provision in this Agreement and fail to remedy such default within
          thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Trident, this Agreement shall terminate effective as of
          the expiration of said thirty (30)-day period. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Party,
          Subscriber shall have no claims against Trident or Britannica or any of its affiliates. Termination of this
          Agreement automatically terminates Subscriber’s and Users’ licenses to use the Services, and any Britannica
          Content or any other materials contained in the Services.

          14. Assignment

          Subscriber may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without
          Trident’s prior written consent.

          15. Dispute Resolution; Governing Law

          a) Dispute Resolution. Provided permitted by Applicable Laws, the parties shall attempt in good faith to
          resolve
          any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement promptly by negotiation between executives who have
          authority to settle the dispute and who are at a higher level of management than the person with direct
          responsibility for administration of this Agreement. Either party may commence mediation by providing a
          written
          request for mediation (“Request for Mediation”) to JAMS and the other party, setting forth the subject matter
          of
          the dispute and the relief requested. If the dispute has not been settled within 45 days following the filing
          of
          a Request for Mediation or within such other time period as the parties may agree in writing, the parties
          shall
          have no further obligation under this paragraph. If one of the parties objects to Mediation or if the
          Mediation
          is terminated, the dispute shall be finally resolved by arbitration conducted under the International
          Arbitration Rules of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution. Either party may initiate arbitration by
